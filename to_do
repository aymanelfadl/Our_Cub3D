# Outstanding Work (most urgent first)

1. **Game Loop & Input** — *DONE*
	- MLX key hooks in `raycasting/ray_casting.c` update `t_player`, clear/ redraw each frame, and cleanly exit on `Esc`.

2. **Texture Loading & Sampling**
	- Load wall textures with `mlx_xpm_file_to_image`, store runtime metadata, and sample them in the ray loop.

3. **Floor/Ceiling Rendering**
	- Fill floor/ceiling with configured colours or textures instead of the black background.

4. **Rendering Loop Structure**
	- Explore `mlx_loop_hook` or a timed redraw to decouple rendering from key events.

5. **Collision Detection**
	- Fine-tune walkability checks (padding near walls, diagonal movement) and add tests.

6. **Resource Cleanup**
	- Destroy MLX images/windows and free parser allocations on shutdown and error paths.

7. **Texture Error Handling**
	- Surface clear runtime errors (texture load, MLX init, render failures) and exit gracefully.

8. **Sprite & Object Support**
	- Parse sprite data, load textures, and render them with depth-sorted drawing.

9. **Automated Runtime Tests**
	- Add smoke/integration tests that exercise the rendering pipeline alongside parser coverage.
