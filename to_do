# Outstanding Work (most urgent first)

1. **Game Loop & Input**
	- Register MLX key hooks, update `t_player` on WASD/arrow keys, re-render each frame, and add a clean exit hook.

2. **Texture Loading & Sampling**
	- Load wall textures with `mlx_xpm_file_to_image`, store runtime metadata, and sample them in the ray loop.

3. **Rendering Loop Structure**
	- Centralize rendering in a reusable function and use `mlx_loop_hook` (or equivalent) to keep frames updating.

4. **Collision Detection**
	- Block movement through walls by checking map cells before applying position deltas.

5. **Resource Cleanup**
	- Destroy MLX images/windows and free parser allocations on shutdown and error paths.

6. **Sprite & Object Support**
	- Parse sprite data, load textures, and render them with depth-sorted drawing.

7. **Floor/Ceiling Rendering**
	- Fill floor/ceiling with configured colours or textures instead of the black background.

8. **Runtime Error Handling**
	- Surface clear runtime errors (texture load, MLX init, render failures) and exit gracefully.

9. **Automated Runtime Tests**
	- Add smoke/integration tests that exercise the rendering pipeline alongside parser coverage.
